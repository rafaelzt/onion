# 🌐 Onion Web Server 🧅

Welcome to the Onion Web Server project! This service hosts a static webpage accessible through a specific .onion URL. A simple, yet effective way to share information on the dark web. 

## 📚 What's Inside?

The service hosts a single `index.html` file. The content of the webpage is completely up to you - unleash your creativity! 🎨

## 🚀 Getting Started

To access the webpage, navigate to `xxxxxxxxx.onion` on a browser that supports .onion domains (like Tor Browser). The page is served over HTTP on port 80. 

## 🛠️ Configuration 

We're using Nginx to configure our web server - it's reliable, efficient, and pretty easy to set up. No other servers or frameworks are allowed in this project, keeping things simple and focused. 

Access to the server is provided through SSH on port 4242. This allows secure remote administration of the server when needed. 

## 🔐 Security

In this project, no additional ports are open and no firewall rules are set up. We keep the server secure and reduce the attack surface by limiting the number of open ports and services running on the server. 

## 🌐 Start Serving!

Now that you know what this project is all about, go ahead and serve your content on the dark web! Remember, with great power comes great responsibility, so always respect privacy and use this service ethically.
